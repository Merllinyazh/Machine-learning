                  LINEAR ALGEBRA IN MACHINE LEARNING

Linear Algebra is the basic mathematics of data.
Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as a1x1 +......+anxn=b
In vector notation we say (a^{T}x=b) Called a linear transformation of x

Linear algebra is fundamental to geometry, for defining objects such as lines,
planes, rotations

Linear equation (a_{1}x_{1}+......+a_{n}x_{n}=b) defines a plane
in ((x1,...,xn)) space, Straight lines define common solutions
to equation

Representation of data:
 
 * How can we represent data in a way that a computer can understand
   Ex Data: images, text, user preferences etc
 * Organize information into vector
 * A Vector is a 1-dimensional array of numbers It has both a magnitude and a direction
 * A feature vector is a vector whose entries represent the "features" of some object
 * A vector space containing them is called feature space
 * Essential for understanding ML algorithms
    E.g., We convert input vectors (x1,...,xn) into outputs by a series of linear     transformations.

DOCUMENTS:

* Given a collection of documents assign to every word a vector whose ith entry is the no. of times the word appears in the ith document.

* These vectors can assemble into large matrix,useful for latent semantic analysis. 

ONE HOT ENCODING:

 One way to represent non-numerical data such as language is to apply one-hot encoding. This assigns to each word a vector with one 1 and 0s elsewhere.

SCALAR:

 Scalar is a single number in contrast to other objects in linear algebra, which are usually arrays of number.It is represented in lower-case italic r. They can be real-valued or be integers. E.g., let ER be the slope of the line - Defining a real-valued scalar. E.g., let nen be the number of units - Defining a natural number scalar.

VECTOR:

 A vector is a 1-D array of numbers each number identified by an index written in lower-case bold such as x its elements are in italics lower case subscripted. If each element is in R then x is in Rn.

MATRICES:

 A matrix is a 2-D arrayof numbers.so each element identified by two indicies
 Denoted by bold typeface A.
 If A has shape of height m and width n with real values then A âˆˆ Rmxn.
 
TENSORS:
 
 Tensors are arrays of numbers, that may have zero dimensions, and be a scalar, one dimension, and be a vector, two dimensions, and be a matrix, or more dimensions. Denote a tensor with this bold typeface: A. Element (i,j,k) of tensor denoted by Aijk.
